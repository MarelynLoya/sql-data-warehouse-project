# 🧱 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project showcases a complete end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution — from raw data ingestion to delivering actionable business insights.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The solution implements the **Medallion Architecture**, organizing data into three progressive layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from CSV files into a SQL Server database.  
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare data for analysis.  
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into star schemas optimized for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository includes:

- **Data Architecture**: Design of a modern data warehouse structured around Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Automated workflows to extract, transform, and load data efficiently.  
- **Data Modeling**: Development of fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical querying.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: SQL-driven insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
